# Linear regreesion on predicting secondhand price for cars

 Linear regression is a method that finds linear relationships between variables. A linear relationship is simply a straight line that passes through the point (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). If this line passes through any point on the graph, then there is a relationship between x and y. Linear regression assumes that there is no noise in our data and we can clearly see when true trends of the data are present. Based on those assumptions, we can determine how much change in price correlated with an increase of sales.


 Linear regression, in statistical analysis, is the technique for finding a linear relationship between another variable and a response variable. The response may be the dependent variable in an experiment, or it may be an independent variable in a theoretical model. In general, simple linear regression leads to equations like:
 
 
### Project involved

- Predicting the second hand price of cars using the linear regression method

- Built linear regression ML model for predicting the price for reselling a particular car.

- Project involved data cleaning, making sure that available data adheres to 7 assumptions of linear regression.

- Processed data is applied to models with 80:20 train and test data set.
